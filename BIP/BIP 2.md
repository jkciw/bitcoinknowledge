The roles and responsibilities of BIP editors, BIPs specifications, criteria for evaluating BIPs are detailed in BIP 2
#### Reasons for rejecting BIPS, according to BIP2
- Disregard for formatting rules
- Too broad/unfocused
- Technically unsound
- Not providing proper motivation
- Not ensuring backwards compatibility
- Not keeping with bitcoin philosophy

#### Minimum Criteria to be met by BIPS
- Clear and complete description of the proposed enhancement
- The enhancement must represent a net improvement
- The proposed implementation must be solid and should not complicate the protocol unduly. 

#### Summary tone of comments
After a while the BIPs wiki page has to be updated with a summary tone of comments received about the BIP, representing the community judgement of the BIP
- No Comments Yet
- Unanimously recommended for implementation
- Unanimously discouraged for implementation
- Mostly recommended for implementation with some discouragement
- Mostly discouraged for implementation with some recommendation 
#### Grievance
- Too much criteria for an editor to consider
- The editor has to form an opinion about the merit of the BIP in order to assess if the BIP represents a net improvement 
- No clear definition of  Bitcoin Philosophy
- Currently, BIPs are licensed under  Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) license BSD-2 clause (or) BSD -3 clause. These are software licenses, are these licenses applicable to plain text ?
- Comment Summary isn't being used effectively - It requires someone (likely the editor) to make judgement about the entirety of comments received. 
#### Proposal
- Editor shouldn't have to examine the meat of the BIP
- Editors should purely focus on formal and editorial issues 
	- formatting 
	- licensing 
	- readability 
	- spam filtering 
- Editors should guide the BIP authors by providing feedback on the presentation of an idea (or) the idea itself. 
- Editorial workflow shouldn't require the editors to make decisions based on the technical and philosophical merit of the BIP.
